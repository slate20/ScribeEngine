### Current State

*   **`gui_launcher.py`**: The entry point for the GUI application is in place, handling Flask server startup and project root management.
*   **`app.py`**: A robust set of Flask routes and API endpoints for GUI interactions (project listing, creation, file management, editor integration) has been implemented, exceeding the initial plan in scope.
*   **HTML Templates**: Essential GUI templates (`launcher.html`, `editor.html`, `_fragments/_project_list.html`, `_fragments/_file_list.html`, `_fragments/_startup_screen.html`) are well-developed and functional.
*   **Client-Side Logic (`gui.js`)**: The JavaScript for the CodeMirror editor, file operations, and UI interactions is comprehensive, including dynamic syntax highlighting, save functionality, and a resizable layout.
*   **Configuration Management**: The `config_manager.py` correctly handles project root persistence.
*   **Project Creation**: The `create_new_project` function is correctly integrated from `main_engine.py`.

### Discrepancies and Missing Pieces

*   **`gui_launcher.py` - Webview Activation**: The `webview.create_window` and `webview.start()` calls are commented out, preventing the GUI from launching as a native desktop window. A placeholder `input()` call is currently keeping the Flask server alive.
*   **`build_engine.py` - GUI Build Logic**:
    *   It currently uses `main_engine.py` as the entry point for both CLI and GUI builds, instead of `gui_launcher.py` for the GUI.
    *   It does not explicitly include all GUI-specific HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the PyInstaller `--add-data` arguments for the GUI build.
*   **`app.py` - Build Game API**: The `/api/build-game/<project_name>` endpoint is a placeholder and does not yet trigger the actual game build process using `build.py`.

### Next Steps for GUI Development

Based on the current implementation and the original plan, the following steps are crucial for completing the Scribe Engine GUI:

1.  **Activate Webview in `gui_launcher.py`**:
    *   Uncomment and ensure the `webview.create_window` and `webview.start()` calls are correctly configured to launch the GUI in a native window.
    *   Remove the temporary `input()` call.

2.  **Refine `build_engine.py` for GUI Executables**:
    *   Modify the `build_engine_executable` function to dynamically set `main_script_path` to `gui_launcher.py` when the `gui` argument is present.
    *   Ensure all necessary GUI-specific files (e.g., `templates/launcher.html`, `templates/editor.html`, `templates/_fragments/*`, `static/css/gui.css`, `static/js/gui.js`, `SE_icon.png`) are correctly included in the PyInstaller `--add-data` arguments for the GUI build.

3.  **Integrate Actual Build Process in `app.py`**:
    *   In the `/api/build-game/<project_name>` route in `app.py`, uncomment and properly call the `build.build_standalone_game` function, passing the correct `project_name` and `project_root`.
    *   Consider adding real-time feedback to the GUI during the build process (e.g., using WebSockets or polling) if feasible.

4.  **UI/UX Refinements and Error Handling**:
    *   Review the overall styling and responsiveness of the GUI.
    *   Implement more robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms for all API calls (e.g., clear messages for failed file operations, project creation errors).
    *   Consider adding a loading indicator for long-running operations like project creation or game builds.

5.  **Engine Settings Control (Project Root Path)**:
    *   **GUI Element**: Add a dedicated section or modal in the GUI (e.g., accessible from the launcher or a settings menu) for managing engine settings. This should include an input field or file picker for the "Project Root Path".
    *   **Default Behavior**: When the GUI is launched for the first time or no project root is configured, the default path should be set to a `projects/` or `games/` directory located in the same directory as the engine executable.
    *   **Backend Integration**: 
        *   Create new Flask routes in `app.py` to:
            *   `GET /api/settings/project_root`: Retrieve the current project root path from `config_manager.py`.
            *   `POST /api/settings/project_root`: Update the project root path using `config_manager.set_project_root()`. This should also handle creating the directory if it doesn't exist.
    *   **Frontend Logic**:
        *   Implement JavaScript in `gui.js` to handle fetching and displaying the current project root.
        *   Add event listeners to save the new project root when the user modifies it.
        *   Ensure that changing the project root updates the displayed list of projects accordingly.

By addressing these points, the Scribe Engine GUI will become a fully functional and distributable desktop application, providing a more user-friendly experience for game development.
