**Phase 1: Foundation & Core Systems**

1. **Project Setup:** We'll define the file structure (`project.json`, `netrunner.tgame`, `custom.css`, `systems.py`).
    
2. **Visual Theme:** I'll generate the `custom.css` to create the cyberpunk terminal aesthetic.
    
3. **Core Logic:** I'll write the initial Python functions in `systems.py`, including the `skill_check()` logic and the functions for managing the `trace_level`.
    
4. **HUD Implementation:** We'll create the `:: PrePassage` to display the dynamic HUD.
    

**Phase 2: Narrative and Gameplay**

1. **Story Outline:** I'll write the `.tgame` content, including the introduction, the core infiltration choices, and the success/failure endings.
    
2. **Linking Logic:** I'll connect the narrative passages using the various link types, including the `#silent` passages for processing outcomes.
    
3. **Mini-Game:** We'll design and implement the logic for the hacking mini-game.
    

**Phase 3: Assets & Polishing**

1. **Asset Integration:** You will provide the assets, and I will integrate them into the game.
    
2. **Sound:** I'll add the HTML and JavaScript hooks for playing ambient music and sound effects.
    
3. **Testing & Balancing:** We'll review the game flow to ensure it's a compelling and clear demonstration of the engine's power.
    

**To begin, I need you to provide the following assets:**

- **Images (PNG format with transparent backgrounds preferably):**
    
    - A "fixer" character portrait (the client who hires you).
        
    - An oppressive, corporate logo for "OmniCorp".
        
    - A simple, blueprint-style image of a server layout or network node map.
        
- **Audio (MP3 or OGG):**
    
    - A looping, ambient synthwave or dark electronic track.
        
    - A short, positive "chime" sound for a successful action.
        
    - A short, negative "buzz" or "error" sound for a failed action.
