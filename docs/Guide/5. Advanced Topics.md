This section covers features for customizing your game's appearance, managing data, and preparing your game for distribution.

### Assets (Images and Audio)

Place all media files (images, audio, video) into the `assets/` directory in your project. To reference them in your `.tgame` files or CSS, use the path `/game/assets/` followed by your filename.

**HTML Example:**

```
<img src="/game/assets/background.png" alt="Background">
<audio controls src="/game/assets/music.mp3"></audio>
```

### Custom Styling with CSS

The `custom.css` file in your project allows you to override the engine's default styles or add your own. This gives you full control over the look and feel of your game.

**Example `custom.css`:**

```
/* MyGame/custom.css */
body {
    font-family: var(--font-family-body); /* Using a variable from project.json */
    background-color: #1a1a1a;
    color: #f0f0f0;
}

a {
    color: var(--primary-color);
    text-decoration: none;
}
a:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
```

### Saving and Loading

Scribe Engine has built-in save and load functionality. The engine saves the entire game state to a file in the `saves/` directory. You can trigger these actions from your game's interface, typically with links that call the engine's `/save` and `/load` routes.

**Example Save Link (in a `.tgame` file):**

```
<a href="#" onclick="saveGame(1)">Save Game (Slot 1)</a>

<script>
  function saveGame(slot) {
    fetch('/save', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
      body: JSON.stringify({slot: slot})
    })
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => alert(data.message || 'Game saved!'));
  }
</script>
```

### Debugging Your Game

When running your game from the launcher, several debug tools are available:

- **Engine Console:** Check the terminal where you launched `scribe-engine` for `debug()` messages and server errors.
    
- **View Game State:** Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/debug/state` in your browser to see a live JSON view of the entire game state. This is invaluable for tracking variables.
    
- **View Passages:** Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/debug/passages` to see a list of all loaded passages.
    

### Building for Distribution

When your game is ready, you can package it into a single executable file for players.

1. Run the `scribe-engine` executable.
    
2. Choose **Option 2: Build Standalone Game** from the **Project Menu**.
    
3. Select the project you want to build.
    
4. The engine will package your game into a `dist/` folder, located in the same directory as the `scribe-engine` executable.
    

The resulting file (e.g., `MyGame.exe` or `MyGame`) is self-contained and can be shared with players.

### Using External Python Libraries

If your game logic requires Python libraries not included with the engine (e.g., `numpy`), you must rebuild the engine itself:

1. Add the library name to the `requirements.txt` file in the engine's source directory.
    
2. Rebuild the `scribe-engine` executable using the provided build script.
    
3. Rebuild your game using the new engine executable.
    

### Custom Flask Routes

For highly complex web integrations, you can add custom routes to the engine's underlying Flask server. This requires modifying the engine's `app.py` source code and rebuilding the engine. This is an advanced feature and is not recommended for typical game logic.
