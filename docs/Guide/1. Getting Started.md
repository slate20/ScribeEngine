This guide will walk you through the initial steps of downloading the Scribe Engine, configuring your workspace, and creating a new game project.

### Obtaining the Scribe Engine

The Scribe Engine is distributed as a single, self-contained executable for Windows and Linux. You do not need to install Python or any dependencies separately.

- **Download:** Obtain the latest `scribe-engine` executable for your operating system from the official distribution channels (e.g., GitHub releases).
    

### Running the Engine

Simply run the `scribe-engine` executable from your terminal or command line.

- **Windows:** Double-click `scribe-engine.exe`.
    
- **Linux:** Make the executable runnable (`chmod +x scribe-engine`) and then run `./scribe-engine`.
    

### First-Run Experience: Setting Your Project Root

The first time you run `scribe-engine`, it will prompt you to set a directory where all your game projects will be stored. This is your "project root."

```
No project root configured or found. Please specify one.
Enter the path for your Scribe Engine game projects (e.g., ~/ScribeEngine_Games):
```

Enter an absolute path (e.g., `/home/youruser/ScribeEngine_Games` on Linux, or `C:\Users\YourUser\Documents\ScribeEngine_Games` on Windows). The engine will create this directory if it doesn't exist and remember it for future sessions.

You can override this path for a single session using the `--project-root` or `-r` argument:

```
./scribe-engine --project-root /path/to/another/games/folder
```

### Main Menu Options

Once the engine is running, you'll be presented with the **Main Menu**:

```
--- Scribe Engine Launcher (Project Root: /path/to/your/ScribeEngine_Games) ---

Main Menu:
1. Create New Project
2. Load Existing Project
3. Change Projects Root Path
4. Exit
```

-   **1. Create New Project:** Guides you through creating a new game with a basic skeleton structure. You'll be prompted to enter a name for your new project.
-   **2. Load Existing Project:** Lists all game projects found in your configured project root and allows you to select one to load.
-   **3. Change Projects Root Path:** Allows you to change the default directory where your game projects are stored.
-   **4. Exit:** Closes the engine launcher.

### Project Menu

After you create a new project or load an existing one, you will automatically transition to the **Project Menu** for the active project:

```
--- Scribe Engine Launcher (Project Root: /path/to/your/ScribeEngine_Games) ---

Active Project: YourProjectName

Project Menu:
1. Start Development Server
2. Build Standalone Game
3. Go Back to Main Menu
4. Quit Engine
```

-   **1. Start Development Server:** Launches the Flask development server for the active project. This makes your game accessible in a web browser (typically at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`). The engine includes **live-reloading**: any changes you make to your game files (`.tgame`, `.py`) will automatically restart the server and reflect in your browser.
-   **2. Build Standalone Game:** Packages the active game project into a single, distributable executable file.
-   **3. Go Back to Main Menu:** Returns you to the Main Menu. If the development server is running, it will be stopped first.
-   **4. Quit Engine:** Exits the launcher. If the development server is running, it will be stopped first.

### Server Running Menu

When the development server is active (after selecting "Start Development Server" from the Project Menu), you will be in the **Server Running Menu**:

```
--- Scribe Engine Launcher (Project Root: /path/to/your/ScribeEngine_Games) ---

Active Project: YourProjectName (Server Running)
Access your game at http://127.0.0.1:5000

Server Running Menu:
1. Stop Development Server
```

-   **1. Stop Development Server:** Shuts down the Flask development server and returns you to the Project Menu.
