# Welcome to Scribe Engine

Scribe Engine is a powerful visual novel engine built with Python and Flask. It allows you to create interactive stories by combining simple text files (`.tgame`), the full power of Python for complex logic, and standard web technologies (HTML/CSS) for presentation.

Unlike some other visual novel tools, Scribe Engine emphasizes programming flexibility, making it ideal for developers who want deep control over their game's mechanics, state, and narrative flow.
